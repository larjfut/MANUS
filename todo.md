# DV Locator System Implementation Todo

## Phase 1: Analyze requirements and design system architecture
- [x] Read and analyze the complete system prompt document
- [x] Understand the CSV data structure and requirements
- [ ] Design the system architecture (backend API + frontend)
- [ ] Plan the geocoding and distance calculation approach
- [ ] Define the JSON response schema and HTML output format

## Phase 2: Create sample data and implement core location-based search functionality
- [x] Create sample DV/SA organization data in CSV format
- [x] Implement geocoding functionality (location to coordinates)
- [x] Implement great-circle distance calculation
- [x] Create core search logic (find closest 5 organizations within 90 miles)
- [x] Test the search functionality with sample data

## Phase 3: Build backend API with Flask framework
- [x] Set up Flask application structure
- [x] Create API endpoints for location-based search
- [x] Implement CSV data loading and processing
- [x] Add error handling and validation
- [x] Test API endpoints

## Phase 4: Create web interface and chatbot frontend
- [x] Design responsive web interface
- [x] Create chatbot-style interaction flow
- [x] Implement location input handling
- [x] Display search results in both JSON and HTML formats
- [x] Add trauma-informed design elements

## Phase 5: Test the complete system and prepare deployment
- [x] Test end-to-end functionality
- [x] Verify distance calculations and result accuracy
- [x] Test with various location inputs (county, city, ZIP)
- [x] Ensure responsive design works on mobile
- [x] Prepare for deployment

## Phase 6: Deliver final system to user
- [ ] Package the complete system
- [ ] Provide documentation and usage instructions
